# Character Creation

Player characters in **AEGEAN** are daring heroes ready to protect their city from enemies—within and without—while seeking their own personal glory.

Character generation is a multi-step package selection process: each player has 10 Creation Points (CP) to spend on their character’s heritage, background, characteristics, and career. You can optionally spend CP on additional careers, skills and advantages. If you need more than 10CP you can take some disadvantages to give yourself some extra points. Any CP left over at the end of character generation are lost so make sure to spend it all.

Use the Walkthrough button to guide you through character creation or the Add button to enter stats directly.
