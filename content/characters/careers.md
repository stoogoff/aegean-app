# Careers

Choose a starting career which reflects your character’s current occupation or role in society. Every character begins the game with one career and a second career can be purchased for 3CP. Starting careers give the character 3 points in different skills and a talent from the first rank of one of the career’s talent tracks or a specialisation from those listed in the career. Starting skills have a maximum rank of 3. New careers can be purchased during the game by spending XP.
