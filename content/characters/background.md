# Background

Your character’s background is where they grew up, how they spent their early years and the impact their family had on them. It also provides some relationships for the character—friends and enemies they’ve made along the way. Choose a background from the following and pick one friend and one enemy from the relationships list. Some backgrounds also provide advantages to your home city. If there is one, note it down for later.
