# Finishing Touches

You now have a character who works mechanically within the rules but there are a few finishing touches to bring them to life. Choose a name for your character and write a brief description of them. If there’s any background details you want to add, now is the time, but keep it brief — the background for your character can add some interesting plot hooks for the GM but your background is in the past and your character’s future is more important.
