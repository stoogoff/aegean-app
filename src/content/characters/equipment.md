# Starting Equipment

Your character begins the game with any personal equipment you feel they need. All characters have basic clothing and a home in the city. You can take any other gear—such as weapons, armour, rich clothing, or tools—as long as it has an availability of Common and a price equal to or lower than your Standing.
Remember to check the encumbrance rules too. Your character can only carry items equal to their Might + 2 before becoming burdened.

Your character has some savings and starts with drakhmae equal to their Standing.
