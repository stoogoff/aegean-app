# Choose a Fate

Your character’s Fate is a goal, belief, or passion which is important
to them. Your character’s Fate drives them to great deeds and should give them a reason to seek adventure. It also works as information for the GM as it tells them what you—the player—want to experience in the game. Mechanically your Fate is a source of growth as acting to fulfil your Fate grants XP at the end of the session.

If, after a couple of sessions, you feel your Fate isn’t working for you you’re free to change it. This shouldn’t happen too often and if you’re struggling to find something that fits your play style and the campaign, speak to the rest of the group to see if they have any suggestions. Likewise, if your Fate is a goal and you complete it, you’re free to pick a new one.
