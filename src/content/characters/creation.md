# Character Creation

Player characters in **AEGEAN** are daring heroes ready to protect their city from enemies—within and without—while seeking their own personal glory.

Character generation is a multi-step package selection process: each player has 10 Creation Points (CP) to spend on their character’s heritage, background, characteristics, and career. You can optionally spend CP on additional careers, skills and advantages. If you need more than 10CP you can take some disadvantages to give yourself some extra points. Any CP left over at the end of character generation are lost so make sure to spend it all.

## Character Concept

The first part of character generation, before looking at any of the mechanics, is to decide on a concept for your character. What is their role in life, their background, their ambitions? You need to decide on their name, age and appearance. What do they look like and where do they come from?

You may have an idea of the character you want to play, in which case you’re good to go. If not there are plenty of places to get some inspiration such as video games, TV, books, movies, or comics. Taking a character from an unrelated setting or time period and re-imagining them in the ancient world can also be a good starting point.

Your character isn’t a homeless wanderer and doesn’t adventure alone. They belong to a city, which will be created later, and should have a connection to the other player characters beyond their home and need for adventure. To help form these connections it’s best to create characters together as part of a session zero so you can discuss your character’s role within the group and the focus of the game you want to play. As a player it’s also important for you to discuss content or situations which you don’t want to include in the game—though at no point do you need to say why you wish to keep a subject away from the game. The purpose of this is to make sure the gaming table is a safe place for all the players, and this goes for the GM too.
