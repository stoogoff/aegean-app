That made the choice of heroic abilities straightforward as there are direct matches to those qualities of AKhilles.\n\nThis didn't give me a good starting point, though. The Hoplitis Captain seems like the most appropriate base profile but that has a focus around strength, rather than speed---it felt more appropriate for someone like Aias son of Telemon. Instead I went with the Amazon Champion profile for its high Reflexes. I changed the equipment to fit that of a wealthy Akhaian warrior and removed the archery related abilities. With a boost to Reflexes and to some skills, plus the previously mentioned heroic abilities, that was Akhilles finished and ready to take to the battlefield.",

Athena, as an arbiter of law, is often appealed to during these trials, as her judgement carries divine weight, but even her intercession might leave the Erinyes angry at being robbed of their vengeance.

    "description": "Driven by deep, gnawing hunger for the blood of the living, these Shades largely cluster at the banks of the Underworld rivers, but during a rite such as the nekyia, they surge forth into the living world to lap up the essence of life contained in the blood spilled for the ritual, or within those who performed it.\n\nHungry Shades are restless and angry, unable to find peace. They direct this anger towards those who are still living, an eternal reminder of the importance of a final send-off. While it is rare to find these ghosts in large numbers unless under the direction of another being or clustered on the shores of the Underworld rivers, they could occur in places where natural disasters have left many corpses unburied or unable to be retrieved.\n\nThere are three kinds of Hungry Shades: Ataphoi, those who were not buried with proper funerary rites; Aōroi, Shades of those whose lives were cut short and died with unfinished business, and Biaiothanatoi, who died violently. These different versions could be reflected by small changes to their stats, for instance giving the Shades of warriors slain in battle armour and weaponry.",

If overpowered, Kerberos can be chained and ransomed back to Haides or Persephone in exchange for a favour, though a chain not reinforced with divine magic won’t hold him for long. To chain Kerberos, a character must Pin him until someone makes a successful Might (Survival) skill check.",
